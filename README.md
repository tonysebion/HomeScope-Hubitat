# HomeScope for Hubitat

HomeScope uses Hubitat as the central device manager while keeping ordinary Hubitat automations independent
from the HomeScope service. This public repository contains only the Hubitat-side distribution package.

The package installs:

- **HomeScope Read Connector** — owner-scoped, read-only discovery through fixed GET routes.
- **HomeScope Observation Bridge** — separately authenticated publication of registered, scalar advisory
  observations.
- **HomeScope Observation Bridge Child** — a fixed sensor-only child driver with no commands.

The read connector and observation bridge intentionally remain separate apps with separate OAuth credentials.
The package does not include Maker API access, device commands, rule changes, generic proxying, or unattended
self-update code.

Version `0.1.0` has passed HomeScope's offline contract and safety tests. Live Hubitat qualification remains an
explicit owner-controlled step.
